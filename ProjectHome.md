The **Neurological Disease Ontology (ND)** is a biomedical ontology for the representation of the range of clinical and basic science aspects of neurological diseases.  ND has a broad scope that includes neurological diseases as well as their associated signs, symptoms, diagnoses, pathologies, etiologies, processes, treatments, and any other aspect of a neurological disease that is or can be encountered in the course of clinical practice or medical research.  ND is being built in accordance with the [OBO Foundry principles](http://www.obofoundry.org/crit.shtml).  It is an extension of the [Ontology for General Medical Science](http://code.google.com/p/ogms/) (OGMS) as well as the [Basic Formal Ontology](http://code.google.com/p/bfo/) (BFO).

ND aims to develop classes utilizing both textual and axiomatized definitions to describe and formalize relations between instances of classes both within the ontology itself as well as between ND and external ontologies such as the:
  * [Gene Ontology](http://www.geneontology.org/) (GO),
  * [Cell Ontology](http://cellontology.org/) (CL),
  * [Protein Ontology](http://pir.georgetown.edu/pro/pro.shtml) (PRO),
  * [Chemical Entities of Biological Interest](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/) (ChEBI), and
  * [Ontology for Biomedical Investigations](http://obi-ontology.org/page/Main_Page) (OBI).

Initial work on ND is focused in three areas:
  * diseases that result in dementia, with a special focus on **Alzheimer’s disease**
  * demyelinating diseases, with a special focus on **multiple sclerosis**
  * **stroke** and cerebrovascular diseases.

Our paper "[The Neurological Disease Ontology"](http://www.jbiomedsem.com/content/4/1/42) was published in the Journal of Biomedical Semantics December of 2013. It introduces the ontology and describes our developmental strategy.

We plan to build ND over the long-term in a collaborative manner with other groups focused on representing particular neurological diseases as modules within ND.  We are also interested in endeavors aimed at the enrichment of non-disease classes (such as pathological protein processes, neuroimaging, etc.) that are of significance to a rigorous representation of neurological diseases.

Ontology development projects related to ND include the:
  * [NeuroPsychological Testing Ontology](http://code.google.com/p/neuropsychological-testing-ontology/) (NPT) and
  * Ocular Disease Ontology (ODO).

There is a [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en&fromgroups#!forum/nd-ontology) for discussing the ND project.  If you are interested in participating in the development of ND, please send an email to addiehl\_at\_buffalo.edu.
